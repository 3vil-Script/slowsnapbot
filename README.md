# slowsnapbot

How to use:
I used Git bash to run the sh script on windows.
You must have adb.
Turn developer mode on and usb debugging, open SnapChat.


Friend_Adder.sh --> First make sure the coordinates are correct for your phone. (Goto developer options and enable pointer location        to check).
Next go to Add friends on SnapCat and tap on the search bar then run the script. It will add all the usernames from the array.

SnapSender.sh --> First make sure the coordinates are correct for your phone.
Goto the page where all your chats are shown and run the script.
This page -->
